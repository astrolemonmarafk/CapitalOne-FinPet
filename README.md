# FinPet 🐾💸

## 💡 Inspiration 💡

Managing personal finances can be stressful and often feels like a chore. Many people struggle with tracking expenses, budgeting, and staying on top of their financial goals. Our team wanted to find a way to make this process more engaging and rewarding. That’s when we came up with **FinPet**—a personal finance app that gamifies financial organization by allowing users to earn points for keeping their finances on track and care for a virtual pet. By combining finance and fun, we hope to build better financial habits in a way that feels enjoyable rather than overwhelming!

## ❓ What it does ❓

**FinPet** transforms financial management into a game! The app rewards you with points for completing tasks such as organizing your expenses, sticking to budgets, and achieving savings goals. These points can then be used to take care of your virtual pet. The healthier your finances, the healthier and happier your pet will be! 

- **Track your finances:** Monitor your income, expenses, and savings in a streamlined dashboard.
- **Earn points:** Keep your finances organized and tasks to earn points.
- **Take care of a virtual pet:** Use the points you earn to feed, play with, and upgrade your pet. As your financial health improves, so does your pet's happiness and well-being!
- **Daily financial challenges:** Tackle mini challenges like staying under budget or categorizing expenses correctly for extra rewards.
  
## 🏗️ How we built it 🏗️

FinPet was developed using a combination of technologies that helped us balance functionality and user engagement:

- **Frontend:** We used **React** to create an intuitive and interactive user interface. Users can easily input financial data, view their dashboard, and interact with their virtual pet.
- **Backend:** The financial data is handled and stored using **Node.js** and **MongoDB**, ensuring a seamless user experience with fast data updates.
- **Virtual Pet Logic:** We implemented a point and reward system where users earn points based on how well they manage their finances. These points are used to keep their virtual pet happy and healthy.
- **Gamification Elements:** Badges, levels, and daily challenges were added to make the process more engaging and rewarding.
- **Dashboard**: Track your expenses, savings goals, and virtual pet's status.
- **Buy Digital Items**: Use earned points to purchase digital items and improve your pet's environment.
- **Connect with Friends**: Share your pet with friends, track expenses together, and compete to save the most.
  
## 🌱 Challenges we ran into 🌱

One of the biggest challenges was finding the right balance between making the app fun without losing sight of its primary goal—helping users stay financially organized. We had to design a virtual pet that reflected users' financial progress in a meaningful way. Additionally, integrating the reward system into the financial tracking process required a lot of brainstorming to ensure both parts of the app felt cohesive.

Another challenge was ensuring the financial dashboard remained user-friendly while displaying complex financial data. We spent considerable time optimizing the UI and data visualization to make it as straightforward as possible.

## 🏆 Accomplishments that we're proud of 🏆

We’re incredibly proud of successfully blending financial management with a game-like experience! Our virtual pet system turned out to be an effective way of incentivizing users to keep their finances organized. We also created a smooth and intuitive interface that makes personal finance accessible even for those who normally find it challenging. Lastly, the daily challenges are a fun way to keep users coming back to the app while staying on top of their financial goals.

## 📘 What we learned 📘

Throughout this project, we learned the importance of designing around user engagement. By gamifying a traditionally boring process like personal finance, we were able to make it enjoyable and approachable. We also learned how to integrate financial logic into a reward system that provides tangible motivation for users. On the technical side, we gained experience in building a full-stack application with **React**, **Node.js**, and **MongoDB**, and learned how to create a gamified reward system that feels balanced and fun.

## 🚀 What's next for FinPet 🚀

In the future, we want to make FinPet even more interactive by adding more customization options for your virtual pet and new ways to earn points. We also plan on adding more advanced financial tools, such as budgeting insights and savings trackers. Additionally, we’d love to introduce community features where users can share their progress, pets, and achievements with others to build a sense of camaraderie around financial health.

## We highly encourage you to try FinPet out!
